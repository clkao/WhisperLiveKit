"""Testable display-state model for the overlay (no AppKit).

The overlay's caption display logic (the hold-drain + provisional→final
replacement + scrollback) is extracted here as a pure state machine that
produces a DOM-like ``DisplayState`` (a list of styled spans per line) from
the event stream (preview/translation/partial/final). The AppKit
``OverlayRenderer`` is a thin view over this model; tests drive the model
with a deterministic event stream and a fake clock, then assert on the
``DisplayState`` without touching the GUI.

Styling (the "DOM"):
  - provisional: dimmed (a draft — clearly not the final word)
  - final same:  bright (unchanged from the provisional)
  - final add:   green (the correction / new words)
  - del spans are OMITTED from the final display (strikethrough is hard to
    read in an overlay; the old words simply vanish, the green adds show
    what changed). The provisional is shown dimmed first, so the reader sees
    the draft, then the bright final with green corrections replaces it.
