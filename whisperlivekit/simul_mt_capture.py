"""Simultaneous-MT capture layer: MLX Q/K attention capture + AlignAtt commit policy.

mlx-lm's ``hunyuan_v1_dense.Attention`` fuses Q/K into
``scaled_dot_product_attention`` and discards the attention weights; this
wrapper replicates the forward with a manual ``softmax(QK^T)`` so the
alignment-head attention is capturable. The forward is bit-identical to the
original (only attention storage is added).

The 8 production head indices + TS scores come from a calibration run on
tencent/Hy-MT2-1.8B (zh→en), hardcoded here so the simultaneous variant is
self-contained.

Load-bearing details (learned during development):
  1. ``create_attention_mask`` returns the string ``"causal"``, not an
     array — the manual forward must build the additive causal mask itself.
  2. ``__call__`` dispatch is on the TYPE, not the instance — must use a
     wrapper ``nn.Module`` whose class defines ``__call__``, not an
     instance ``__call__`` assignment.
