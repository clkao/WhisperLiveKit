"""Standardized caption event stream — the contract between ASR+MT generation
and the display/test layers.

Parallel tap (spike): the pipeline emits these events alongside building
``FrontData``. ``FrontData`` (the web UI wire protocol) is untouched — it
stays built by ``audio_processor``. The event stream is the testable seam:
it carries the caption event types so generation can be tested for coherence
independently of how the display renders it.

Event types (named by what the viewer sees, not which subsystem produced it,
aligning with the overlay's partial/preview/translation vocabulary and the
FrontData buffer_transcription/buffer_translation fields):

  - ``transcription_provisional`` : the unstable ASR tail (rolling hypothesis,
    not committed) — what the viewer sees as the in-progress source line.
  - ``transcription_final``   : committed ASR tokens (a finalized segment).
  - ``translation_provisional``: provisional translation (AlignAtt release
    against committed source; held target is NOT released yet).
    ``compute=True`` if a fresh MT forward pass produced this draft;
    ``compute=False`` if it was a free release from cached attention (the
    hysteresis distinction — exposes call count vs emission count).
  - ``translation_final``     : finalized translation (quality pass at a
    boundary).

The display layer derives its own state from this stream; the web UI keeps
using ``FrontData`` snapshots unchanged.
